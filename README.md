RE315 - Laptop Project
======================

The purpose of this project was to find and implement several methods to
bypass disk encryption systems. This repository is divided into 5
parts:

- `Luks`: bypass methods targeting the Luks disk encryption system, both on
  Debian and Fedora based operating systems
- `TrueCrypt`: bypass methods targeting TrueCrypt
- `BitLocker`: bypass BitLocker when it is used without a TPM
- `usb_key`: source code to create a light and bootable usb key to perform
  the previous attacks
- `rapport`: LaTeX source code of the project report

Other `README` files are available in subdirectories for more explanations.
